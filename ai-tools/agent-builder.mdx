## Overview

Avallon's AI Agent Builder integrates with n8n to create intelligent automation agents. Build workflows that can handle complex tasks automatically.

## What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are automated workflows powered by n8n that can:

- Integrate with external services
- Handle repetitive tasks
- Respond to events and triggers

## Creating an Agent

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Agent Builder**
2. Click "Create New Agent"
3. Describe what you want your agent to do
4. Configure agent settings:
   - **Name**: Give your agent a name
   - **Description**: What the agent does
   - **Triggers**: When the agent should run
   - **Actions**: What the agent should do
5. Click "Create Agent"
6. The agent will be created in n8n
