## Overview

Avallon automatically generates multi-page websites by default. Each website includes multiple pages with working navigation between them.

## Default Pages

When you generate a website, Avallon creates:

- **Index/Home**: Main landing page
- **About**: About page with information
- **Services/Features**: What you offer
- **Contact**: Contact form and information

## Page Types by Industry

Avallon automatically selects appropriate pages based on your description:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Restaurant">
    Home, Menu, Reservations, Location, Contact
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portfolio">
    Home, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-commerce">
    Home, Products, About, Cart, Contact
  </Card>
  <Card title="SaaS">
    Home, About, Features, Pricing, Contact
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Navigating Between Pages
