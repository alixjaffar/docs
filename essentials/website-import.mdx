## Multi-Page Import

When importing a multi-page website:

1. Avallon automatically discovers internal links
2. Crawls pages using breadth-first search
3. Rewrites links to work within Avallon
4. Preserves navigation structure

### Page Limits

- **Max Pages**: Set how many pages to import (default: 10)
- **Max Depth**: Set how many link levels to follow (default: 3)

<Warning>
Importing many pages or deep sites may take longer and use more credits.
</Warning>

## After Import

Once imported, you can:

- **Edit Visually**: Use the visual editor to modify the imported site
- **Use AI Assist**: Ask for modifications using natural language
- **Add Pages**: Create new pages and link them
- **Publish**: Deploy your imported and edited site

## Navigation

Imported multi-page sites automatically have working navigation:

- Internal links redirect to scraped pages within Avallon
- Buttons with navigation work correctly
- Forms submit to the correct pages
- All links are rewritten to work in the editor

<Info>
The import process preserves all CSS styles, images, and functionality while making the site editable in Avallon.
