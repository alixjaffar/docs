description: Connect your own domain to your Avallon site
---

## Overview

Connect your own domain name to your Avallon website. This allows you to host your site on your own custom domain instead of the default preview URL.

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

### Step 1: Add Your Domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Custom Domains**
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
4. Click "Add Domain"

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Avallon will generate DNS records for you:

- **A Record**: For the root domain (example.com)
- **CNAME Record**: For the www subdomain (www.example.com)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="A Record">
    ```
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: [Avallon IP Address]
    TTL: 3600
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="CNAME Record">
    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: [Avallon Host]
    TTL: 3600
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 3: Add DNS Records

1. Log in to your domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Go to DNS management
3. Add the A record for the root domain
4. Add the CNAME record for www
5. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-30 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify DNS

1. Return to Avallon Settings
2. Click "Verify DNS" next to your domain
3. Avallon will check if the DNS records are configured correctly
4. Once verified, your domain status will change to "Active"

## DNS Verification

Avallon uses Google's DNS-over-HTTPS API to verify your DNS records. The verification checks:

- A record points to the correct IP
- CNAME record points to the correct host
- Records are properly configured

<Info>
DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though most changes take effect within minutes.
</Info>

## Domain Status

Your domain can have the following statuses:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pending">
    Domain added but DNS not yet configured
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verifying">
    DNS verification in progress
  </Card>
  <Card title="Active">
    DNS configured correctly, domain is live
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error">
    DNS configuration issue, check your records
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS Not Verifying">
    - Wait 5-30 minutes after adding DNS records
    - Double-check the DNS record values match exactly
    - Ensure TTL is set correctly
    - Try clearing your DNS cache
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domain Not Loading">
    - Verify DNS records are correct
    - Check domain status in Avallon
    - Ensure domain is connected to the correct site
    - Contact support if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSL Certificate">
    Avallon automatically provisions SSL certificates for verified domains. This may take a few minutes after DNS verification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Domains

You can connect multiple domains to the same site:

1. Add each domain in Settings
2. Configure DNS for each domain
3. Verify each domain separately
4. All domains will point to the same site

<Warning>
Each domain must have its own DNS records configured. You cannot reuse the same records for multiple domains.
</Warning>
